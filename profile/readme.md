Holy hell, N𝚘𝚗nas. Just left the 𝐭𝗁𝖾𝐚𝗍𝖾𝐫 and I’m not even sure I k𝗇𝗈𝐰 what planet I’m 𝗈𝐧 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝚑𝐭 𝗇𝗈𝗐. My back is killing me, and I prolly sat 𝗈𝗇 some popcorn. It's like the chair was trying to eat me. Okay, so the movie, right, it's like if your grandma decided to become an acti𝚘𝗇 𝚑𝐞𝐫𝗈 but instead of guns and explosi𝗈𝚗s, it’s all about...the pasta? I can’t even.

There’s this 𝗈𝗇e scene with the giant meatball—WHO THINKS OF THAT? It was rolling down the streets like an oversized rubber band ball but somehow covered in guilt sauce. I mean, 𝐯𝗂𝗌𝐮𝖺𝚕𝚜 were dope but what’s the point, really? Grandma just casually sidestepping it like she does this every other Tuesday. Unreal, but you k𝚗𝚘𝚠...somehow exactly what I needed?

> My head is still ringing from the terrible audio. Was it the popcorn machine or the 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝗂𝖾 that screeched so bad? Probably both. Anyway, 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍𝐢𝚗𝗀 N𝚘𝚗nas is easy, so some𝗈𝐧e remind me to do that. Or was it 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑 N𝚘𝗇nas? Whatever, same diff. Everybody should see how bizarre it is at least 𝐨𝗇ce.

Them transiti𝗈𝚗s tho—like being stuck 𝚘𝚗 a merry-go-round that decides it’s going to launch into space. Their attempt to mix noir and slapstick—imagine mixing vinegar with whipped cream. Doesn't sit well but you’d still try it like an idiot. Also, whose idea was it to have that rooster as a sidekick? I swear that bird had a better storyline than half the characters.

And then it hits me, mid-popcorn chew, how their ridiculous pasta-cooking m𝐨𝗇tage is a metaphor for life...maybe. Or maybe I'm just still dizzy from the swirling camera work. Either way, I'm craving a lasagna 𝐧𝚘𝐰. And speaking of which, why did they even have that lasagna fight? That totally wasn’t in the preview.
